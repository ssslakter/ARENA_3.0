    "- `trigram_*`, which are three metrics specifically for the trigram dataset (i.e. the dataset consisting of only the dataset's special trigrams, i.e. the sequences `(a, b, c)` where `c` always directly follows `ab`). These metrics are only computed on the last token (i.e. the 3rd one) in each sequence. We have:\n",
    "    - `trigram_n_correct` = number of trigrams that were correctly predicted\n",
    "    - `trigram_frac_correct` = fraction of total trigrams that were correctly predicted\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that `trigram_frac_correct` is higher than `trigram_avg_correct_prob`, because some trigrams are predicted with slightly higher than uniform probability but still far from certainty. Also note that neither of these values has hit 100%, indicating that the model has learned most but not all of the trigrams. You can investigate these results for yourself when you inspect the model below!"
