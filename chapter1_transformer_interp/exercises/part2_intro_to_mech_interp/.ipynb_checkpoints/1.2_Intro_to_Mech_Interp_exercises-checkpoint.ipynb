    "2. You are given an exercise, in which you have to apply the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The running theme of the exercises is **induction circuits**. Induction circuits are a particular type of circuit in a transformer, which can perform basic in-context learning. You should read the [corresponding section of Neel's glossary](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=_Jzi6YHRHKP1JziwdE02qdYZ), before continuing.

    "## Content & Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ TransformerLens: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is designed to get you up to speed with the TransformerLens library. You'll learn how to load and run models, and learn about the shared architecture template for all of these models (the latter of which should be familiar to you if you've already done the exercises that come before these, since many of the same design principles are followed).\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Load and run a `HookedTransformer` model\n",
    "> - Understand the basic architecture of these models\n",
    "> - Use the model's tokenizer to convert text to tokens, and vice versa\n",
    "> - Know how to cache activations, and to access activations from the cache\n",
    "> - Use `circuitsvis` to visualise attention heads\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Finding induction heads\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you'll learn about induction heads, how they work and why they are important. You'll also learn how to identify them from the characteristic induction head stripe in their attention patterns when the model input is a repeating sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Understand what induction heads are, and the algorithm they are implementing\n",
    "> - Inspect activation patterns to identify basic attention head patterns, and write your own functions to detect attention heads for you\n",
    "> - Identify induction heads by looking at the attention patterns produced from a repeating random sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ TransformerLens: Hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you'll learn about hooks, which are a great feature of TransformerLens allowing you to access and intervene on activations within the model. We will mainly focus on the basics of hooks and using them to access activations (we'll mainly save the causal interventions for the later IOI exercises). You will also build some tools to perform logit attribution within your model, so you can identify which components are responsible for your model's performance on certain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Understand what hooks are, and how they are used in TransformerLens\n",
    "> - Use hooks to access activations, process the results, and write them to an external tensor\n",
    "> - Build tools to perform attribution, i.e. detecting which components of your model are responsible for performance on a given task\n",
    "> - Understand how hooks can be used to perform basic interventions like **ablation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Reverse-engineering induction circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, these exercises show you how you can reverse-engineer a circuit by looking directly at a transformer's weights (which can be considered a \"gold standard\" of interpretability; something not possible in every situation). You'll examine QK and OV circuits by multiplying through matrices (and learn how the FactoredMatrix class makes matrices like these much easier to analyse). You'll also look for evidence of composition between two induction heads, and once you've found it then you'll investigate the functionality of the full circuit formed from this composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Understand the difference between investigating a circuit by looking at activation patterns, and reverse-engineering a circuit by looking directly at the weights\n",
    "> - Use the factored matrix class to inspect the QK and OV circuits within an induction circuit\n",
    "> - Perform further exploration of induction circuits: composition scores, and targeted ablations"

    "*Note - most of this is written from the POV of Neel Nanda.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](neelnanda.io)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **Check out my [list of concrete open problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WONBzNqfKIxERejrrPlQMyKqg7jSFW92x5UMXNrMdPo/edit#) to figure out where to start.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
    "\n",
    "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"

The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",

So a natural place to start is classifying heads by their attention patterns on various texts.\n",

    "- It has only attention blocks.\n",
    "- The positional embeddings are only added to the residual stream before calculating each key and query vector in the attention layers as opposed to the token embeddings - i.e. we compute queries as `Q = (resid + pos_embed) @ W_Q + b_Q` and same for keys, but values as `V = resid @ W_V + b_V`. This means that **the residual stream can't directly encode positional information**.\n",
    "    - This turns out to make it *way* easier for induction heads to form, it happens 2-3x times earlier - [see the comparison of two training runs](https://wandb.ai/mechanistic-interpretability/attn-only/reports/loss_ewma-22-08-24-11-08-83---VmlldzoyNTI0MDMz?accessToken=8ap8ir6y072uqa4f9uinotdtrwmoa8d8k2je4ec0lyasf1jcm3mtdh37ouijgdbm) here.

    "(Note: I use induction **head** to refer to the head in the second layer which attends to the 'token immediately after the copy of the current token', and induction **circuit** to refer to the circuit consisting of the composition of a **previous token head** in layer 0 and an **induction head** in layer 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Induction heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#induction-heads) are the first sophisticated circuit we see in transformers! And are sufficiently interesting that we wrote [another paper just about them](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html).\n",

    "<summary>An aside on why induction heads are a big deal</summary>\n",

    "There's a few particularly striking things about induction heads:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They develop fairly suddenly in a phase change - from about 2B to 4B tokens we go from no induction heads to pretty well developed ones. This is a striking divergence from a 1L model [see the comparison of in context learning performance curves curves for models with different layers](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html#:~:text=Our%20first%20observation) and can be observed in much larger models (eg a 13B one)\n",
    "    * Phase changes are particularly interesting (and depressing) from an alignment perspective, because the prospect of a sharp left turn, or emergent capabilities like deception or situational awareness seems like worlds where alignment may be harder, and we get caught by surprise without warning shots or simpler but analogous models to test our techniques on.\n",
    "* They are responsible for a significant loss decrease - so much so that there's a visible bump in the loss curve when they develop (this change in loss can be pretty comparable to the increase in loss from major increases in model size, though this is hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison)\n",
    "* They seem to be responsible for the vast majority of in-context learning - the ability to use far back tokens in the context to predict the next token. This is a significant way in which transformers outperform older architectures like RNNs or LSTMs, and induction heads seem to be a big part of this.\n",
    "* The same core circuit seems to be used in a bunch of more sophisticated settings, such as translation or few-shot learning - there are heads that seem clearly responsible for those *and* which double as induction heads.\n",

In brief, however, the induction circuit consists of a previous token head in layer 0 and an induction head in layer 1, where the induction head learns to attend to the token immediately *after* copies of the current token via K-Composition with the previous token head.\n",

    "\n",
    "(The attention pattern *does* in fact include effects from other tokens because of softmax - if another key token has a high attention score, softmax inhibits this pair. But this inhibition is symmetric across positions, so can't systematically favour the token *next* to the relevant one.)\n",

    "\n",
    "[PyTorch hooks](https://blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-hooks-gradient-clipping-debugging/) are a great and underrated, yet incredibly janky, feature. They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "They also come with a range of other quality of life improvements. PyTorch's hooks are global state, which can be a massive pain if you accidentally leave a hook on a model. TransformerLens hooks are also global state, but `run_with_hooks` tries to create an abstraction where these are local state by removing all hooks at the end of the function (and they come with a helpful `model.reset_hooks()` method to remove all hooks).\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>How are TransformerLens hooks actually implemented?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "They are implemented as modules with the identity function as their forward method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class HookPoint(nn.Module):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "but also with special features for adding and removing hook functions. This is why you see hooks when you print a HookedTransformer model, because all its modules are recursively printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the model normally, hook modules won't change the model's behaviour (since applying the identity function does nothing). It's only once you add functions to the hook modules (e.g. a function which ablates any inputs into the hook module) that the model's behaviour changes.\n",

    "## Hooks: Accessing Activations\n",
    "\n",
    "In later sections, we'll write some code to intervene on hooks, which is really the core feature that makes them so useful for interpretability. But for now, let's just look at how to access them without changing their value. This can be achieved by having the hook function write to a global variable, and return nothing (rather than modifying the activation in place).\n",

    "Why might we want to do this? It turns out to be useful for things like:\n",

So `logits = (embed @ W_U) + (attn_out @ W_U) + (attn_out_1 @ W_U)`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can be even more specific, and *just* look at the logit of the Potter token - this corresponds to a column of `W_U`, and so a direction in the residual stream - our logit is now a single number that is the sum of `(embed @ potter_U) + (attn_out_0 @ potter_U) + (attn_out_1 @ potter_U)`. Even better, we can decompose each attention layer output into the sum of the result of each head, and use this to get many terms.\n",

    "* By looking at just the logits corresponding to the correct token, our data is much lower dimensional because we can ignore all other tokens other than the correct next one (Dealing with a 50K vocab size is a pain!). But this comes at the cost of missing out on more subtle effects, like a head suppressing other plausible logits, to increase the log prob of the correct one.\n",
    "    * There are other situations where our job might be easier. For instance, in the IOI task (which we'll discuss shortly) we're just comparing the logits of the indirect object to the logits of the direct object, meaning we can use the **difference between these logits**, and ignore all the other logits.\n",
    "* When calculating correct output logits, we will get tensors with a dimension `(position - 1,)`, not `(position,)` - we remove the final element of the output (logits), and the first element of labels (tokens). This is because we're predicting the *next* token, and we don't know the token after the final token, so we ignore it.\n",

    "An alternative to zero-ablation is **mean-ablation**, where rather than setting values to zero, we set them to be their mean across some suitable distribution (commonly we'll use the mean over some batch dimension). This can be more informative, because zero-ablation takes a model out of its normal distribution, and so the results from it aren't necessarily representative of what you'd get if you \"switched off\" the effect from some particular component. Mean ablation on the other hand works slightly better (although it does come with its own set of risks). You can read more [here](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/glossary#:~:text=Ablation%20aka%20Knockout) or [here](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.15255v1).\n",

You should see that the results are slightly cleaner, with the unimportant heads having values much closer to zero relative to the important heads."

    "Some observations from the result of this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Head `0.7` is truly a previous token head.** The second row shows that mean ablating all its inputs except for those that come from the previous token has no effect on loss, so this is all the information it's using.\n",
    "- **Head `0.11` is only a current token head.** The first row shows that mean ablating all its inputs except for those that come from self-attending (i.e. to the current token) has no effect on loss, so this is all the information it's using.\n",
    "- **Head `0.4` is only using information from positions 1, 2 or 3 tokens back.** This is shown from the 5th row of the plot above - the effect of ablating all inputs except for those that come from tokens 1 or 2 positions back is very small. Note that it's important we draw this conclusion from an ablation experiment, not just from looking at attention patterns - because attending to a token doesn't tell you whether that token is being used for a way that's important in the context of this particular distribution (induction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with `0.11` - we know that there are heads in layer 1 whose job it is to copy tokens - i.e. in sequences `[A][B]...[A][B]`, they attend from the second `[A]` back to the first `[B]` and copy its value to use as a prediction. And if head `0.11` always self-attends, then it actually makes sense to consider `(embedding of B) + (output of head 0.11 when it attends to token B)` as the \"true embedding of `B`\", since this is always the thing that the layer 1 head will be learning to copy. This idea of an **extended embedding** or **effective embedding** will come up again later in the course, when we look at GPT2-Small. As for whether the output of `0.11` is more important in the QK circuit of the layer-1 copying head, or the OV copying head, we'll leave as an exercise to the reader!\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, `0.4` - it's using information from both 1 and 2 tokens back. Using the previous token makes sense, since induction circuits contain previous token heads. But what could it be doing with the information 2 positions back? One theory we might have is that it's also creating an induction circuit, but using 3 tokens rather than 2 tokens! In other words, rather than having sequences like `[A][B]...[A][B]` where the second `[A]` attends back to \"token that came immediately after the value of this token\", we might have sequences like `[Z][A][B]...[Z][A][B]` where the second `[A]` attends back to \"token that came 2 positions after the value of the previous token\". One way to test this would be to construct random induction sequences which have a maximum of 2 repetitions, i.e. they're constructed with the first half being random sequences and the second half being pairs of randomly chosen tokens which appear in the first half adjacent to each other. To illustrate, for vocab size of 10 and half seq len of 10, we might have a sequence like:\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on our theory about head `0.4`, we should expect that mean ablating it in this kind of sequence should have nearly zero effect on loss (because it's designed to support induction sequences of length at least 3), even though all the other heads which were identified as important in the induction experiment (`0.7`, `0.11`, `1.4`, `1.10`) should still be important.

This might be a good way to get a feel for the circuit, but it's not a very rigorous way to understand it.

    "## Refresher - the induction circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the meat of this section, let's refresh the results we've gotten so far from investigating induction heads. We've found:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When fed repeated sequences of tokens, heads `1.4` and `1.10` have the characteristic induction head attention pattern of a diagonal stripe with offset `seq_len - 1`.\n",
    "    * We saw this both from the CircuitsVis results, and from the fact that these heads had high induction scores by our chosen metric (with all other heads having much lower scores).\n",
    "* We also saw that head `0.7` strongly attends to the previous token in the sequence (even on non-repeated sequences).\n",
    "* We performed **logit attribution** on the model, and found that the values written to the residual stream by heads `1.4` and `1.10` were both important for getting us correct predictions in the second half of the sequence.\n",
    "* We performed **zero-ablation** on the model, and found that heads `0.7`, `1.4` and `1.10` all resulted in a large accuracy degradation on the repeated sequence task when they were ablated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on all these observations, try and summarise the induction circuit and how it works, in your own words. You should try and link your explanation to the QK and OV circuits for particular heads, and describe what type (or types) of attention head composition are taking place.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the dropdown below to check your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>My summary of the algorithm</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Head `0.7` is a previous token head (the QK-circuit ensures it always attends to the previous token).\n",
    "* The OV circuit of head `0.7` writes a copy of the previous token in a *different* subspace to the one used by the embedding.\n",
    "* The output of head `0.7` is used by the *key* input of head `1.10` via K-Composition to attend to 'the source token whose previous token is the destination token'.\n",
    "* The OV-circuit of head `1.10` copies the *value* of the source token to the same output logit.\n",
    "    * Note that this is copying from the embedding subspace, *not* the `0.7` output subspace - it is not using V-Composition at all.\n",
    "* `1.4` is also performing the same role as `1.10` (so together they can be more accurate - we'll see exactly how later).\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasise - the sophisticated hard part is computing the *attention* pattern of the induction head - this takes careful composition. The previous token and copying parts are fairly easy. This is a good illustrative example of how the QK circuits and OV circuits act semi-independently, and are often best thought of somewhat separately. And that computing the attention patterns can involve real and sophisticated computation!\n",

    "Before we start, a brief terminology note. I'll refer to weight matrices for a particular layer and head using superscript notation, e.g. $W_Q^{1.4}$ is the query matrix for the 4th head in layer 1, and it has shape `[d_model, d_head]` (remember that we multiply with weight matrices on the right). Similarly, attention patterns will be denoted $A^{1.4}$ (remember that these are **activations**, not parameters, since they're given by the formula $A^h = x W_{QK}^h x^T$, where $x$ is the residual stream (with shape `[seq_len, d_model]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a shorthand, I'll often have $A$ denote the one-hot encoding of token `A` (i.e. the vector with zeros everywhere except a one at the index of `A`), so $A^T W_E$ is the embedding vector for `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I'll refer to special matrix products as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $W_{OV}^{h} := W_V^{h}W_O^{h}$ is the **OV circuit** for head $h$, and $W_E W_{OV}^h W_U$ is the **full OV circuit**.\n",
    "* $W_{QK}^h := W_Q^h (W_K^h)^T$ is the **QK circuit** for head $h$, and $W_E W_{QK}^h W_E^T$ is the **full QK circuit**.\n",
    "\n",

For instance, both full circuit matrices have shape $(d_\\text{vocab}, d_\\text{vocab})$, which in our case means $50278\\times 50278 \\approx 2.5\\times 10^{9}$ elements. Even if your GPU can handle this, it still seems inefficient. Is there any way we can meaningfully analyse these matrices, without actually having to calculate them?\n",

For an even more extreme example, the full OV circuit can be written as $(W_E W_V^h) (W_O^h W_U)$, where these two matrices have shape `[50278, 64]` and `[64, 50278]` respectively. Similarly, we can write the full QK circuit as $(W_E W_Q^h) (W_E W_K^h)^T$.\n",

It can (approximately) act as a drop-in replacement for the original matrix.\n",

This is what we expect, and is a good indication that our composition scores are working as intended.\n",

    "Another interesting thing to note is that the V-composition scores for heads `1.4` and `1.10` with all other heads in layer 0 are very low. In the context of the induction circuit, this is a good thing - the OV circuits of our induction heads should be operating on the **embeddings**, rather than the outputs of the layer-0 heads. (If our repeating sequence is `A B ... A B`, then it's the QK circuit's job to make sure the second `A` attends to the first `B`, and it's the OV circuit's job to project the residual vector at that position onto the **embedding space** in order to extract the `B`-information, while hopefully ignoring anything else that has been written to that position by the heads in layer 0). So once again, this is a good sign for our composition scores.\n",

But this follows from the fact that the Frobenius norm is the sum of the squared $l_2$ norms of the column vectors of $M$, and orthogonal matrices preserve $l_2$ norms. (If we're right-multiplying $M$ by an orthogonal matrix, then we instead view this as performing orthogonal operations on the row vectors of $M$, and the same argument holds.)\n",

    "### Further discussion / investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic has written a post on [In-context Learning and Induction Heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html) which goes into much deeper discussion on induction heads. The post is structured around six different points of evidence for the hypothesis that **induction heads are the main source of in-context learning in transformer models**, even large ones. Briefly, these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transformers undergo a \"phase change\" where they suddenly become much better at in-context learning, and this is around the same time induction heads appear.\n",
    "2. When we change the transformer's architecture to make it easier for induction heads to form, we get a corresponding improvement in in-context learning.\n",
    "3. When we ablate induction heads at runtime, in-context learning gets worse.\n",
    "4. We have specific examples of induction heads performing more complex in-context learning algorithms (you'll have the opportunity to investigate one of these later - **indirect object identification**).\n",
    "5. We have a mechanistic explanation of induction heads, which suggests natural extensions to more general forms of in-context learning.\n",
    "6. In-context learning-related behaviour is generally smoothly continuous between small and large models, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is also the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few questions for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How compelling do you find this evidence? Discuss with your partner.\n",
    "    * Which points do you find most compelling?\n",
    "    * Which do you find least compelling?\n",
    "    * Are there any subset of these which would be enough to convince you of the hypothesis, in the absence of others?\n",
    "* In point 3, the paper observes that in-context learning performance degrades when you ablate induction heads. While we measured this by testing the model's ability to copy a duplicated random sequence, the paper used **in-context learning score** (the loss of the 500th token in the context, minus the loss on the 50th token).\n",
    "    * Can you see why this is a reasonable metric?\n",
    "    * Can you replicate these results (maybe on a larger model than the 2-layer one we've been using)?\n",
    "* In point 4 (more complex forms of in-context learning), the paper suggests the natural extension of \"fuzzy induction heads\", which match patterns like `[A*][B*]...[A][B]` rather than `[A][B]...[A][B]` (where the `*` indicates some form of linguistic similarity, not necessarily being the same token).\n",
    "    * Can you think of any forms this might take, i.e. any kinds of similarity which induction heads might pick up on? Can you generate examples?"
